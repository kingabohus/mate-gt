# MATE #
A graph and tree  transducer including a development environment for grammars, lexica, and other resoucres.
We call it MATE since "It's like a little helper buddy". It helps to develop linguistic resoucres for Natural Language Processing such as Natural Language Generation. MATE was mainly used in the frame work of the [Meaning Text Theory](http://meaningtext.net/Main_Page).

For further information, please have a look at [our paper](http://www.lrec-conf.org/proceedings/lrec2010/pdf/585_Paper.pdf) and please cite it, if you use MATE:
